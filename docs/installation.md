# Installation

The plugin can be installed either through the [Plugin Store](https://plugins.craftcms.com/) or through [Composer](https://packagist.org/).

### Plugin Store
Open the control panel for your website. Navigate to **Settings &rarr; Plugins** and search for **Neo**. Click **Install**.

### Composer
Run the following command in the root directory of your Craft project:
```
composer require spicyweb/craft-neo
```


## Requirements

### Craft version
Neo 5 requires Craft CMS 5.

### Browser support
Neo supports the same [browsers and versions that Craft CMS 5 supports](https://craftcms.com/docs/5.x/requirements.html#control-panel-browser-requirements). While Neo may work on browsers outside of those listed, this list is what Neo explicitly supports. The best option is to use an up-to-date major browser.
